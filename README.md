# 3D Computer Vision Basics, 2025 Fall Semester

## Schedule
* 1/7 – Stereo Vision Part 1
* 1/21 – Stereo Vision Part 2
* 1/28 - 奈良県立医科大学の見学
* **1/31 - Final Report Deadline (submitted via LMS)**

## Overview - From Pixels to 3D Worlds!
This course introduces the fundamental principles of 3D computer vision, exploring how images captured by cameras can be transformed into meaningful 3D reconstructions. 
Students will learn the mathematical and computational foundations behind stereo vision and its real-world applications.
